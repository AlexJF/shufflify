# Shufflify

[Visit the Shufflify website](http://shufflify.alexjf.net)

A Web app to allow the automatic creation of a Spotify playlist containing a random sample of all tracks in a set of Spotify sources (either 'Your music' library or other playlists).

Cool use cases:

* Work around the 3333 offline-saved songs per-device by choosing a random 3333 track sample from your music library.
* Limit the size of your offline-saved collection by offline-saving a random limited-size sample from your music library.
* Shuffle the order of the tracks in a playlist in a truly random way (not according to Spotify's sometimes weird randomness that plays the same track several times).
* Join several playlists together without duplicates or remove duplicates from a single playlist.
