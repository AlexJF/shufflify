# Shufflify

A Web app to allow the automatic creation of a playlist containing a random sample of all tracks in a set of sources (either 'Your music' library or other playlists).

Cool use cases:

* Work around the 3333 offline-saved songs per-device by choosing a random 3333 track sample from your music library.
* Limit the size of your offline-saved collection by offline-saving a random limited-size sample from your music library.
